## Overview

The E2E Security Test Report provides comprehensive visibility into the security detection capabilities of the Falco nginx plugin. Each test run executes **65 attack patterns** across 5 categories and generates a detailed report showing:

- Detection rate (target: 100%)
- Per-category breakdown
- Individual test case details
- Trend analysis across runs

---

## Report URL

The E2E test reports are available at the following URLs:

| URL | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **https://takaosgb3.github.io/falco-plugin-nginx/e2e-report/latest/** | Latest report (always points to the most recent run) |
| **https://takaosgb3.github.io/falco-plugin-nginx/e2e-report/{run_number}/** | Specific run (e.g., run #26) |

### Examples

- **Latest**: https://takaosgb3.github.io/falco-plugin-nginx/e2e-report/latest/
- **Run #26**: https://takaosgb3.github.io/falco-plugin-nginx/e2e-report/26/

## Test Case Details

![Test Case Details](images/e2e-report-test-detail.png)

Each test case provides detailed information about the attack pattern and detection result:

### Attack Pattern Information

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Pattern ID | Unique identifier | `SQLI_TIME_001` |
| Name | Human-readable name | "Basic MySQL SLEEP function" |
| Category | Attack category | SQLI |
| Subcategory | Specific attack type | time_based_blind |
| Severity | Risk level | HIGH |

### Attack Details

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Payload | Raw attack string | `SLEEP(5)` |
| Encoded | URL-encoded version | `SLEEP%285%29` |
| Expected Detection | Should be detected | Yes |

### Test Execution Results

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Status | Test outcome | PASSED |
| Detection Count | Detected / Expected | 1 / 1 |
| Latency | Time to detect | ~22000ms |
| Timestamp | Detection time | 13:45:55.000 UTC |

### Detection Evidence

The actual Falco log entry that detected the attack:

```
13:45:55.000000000: Critical [NGINX SQLi] Time-based Blind SQL Injection
test_id=SQLI_TIME_001-1765115155414-grzegk
pattern_id=SQLI_TIME_001
uri=/?q=SLEEP%285%29
client=127.0.0.1
method=GET
```

### Execution Steps

Each test includes execution steps with attachments:

1. **k6 Test Execution Result** - Raw test execution data (JSON)
2. **Log Files** - nginx access log and Falco log snippets
3. **Detection Evidence (Highlighted)** - HTML view with keyword highlighting
4. **Verification Result** - Pass/fail determination

---

## Highlight Feature

![Highlight Feature](images/e2e-report-highlight.png)

The **Detection Evidence (Highlighted)** attachment uses **fluorescent yellow highlighting** to make attack payloads easily visible in log entries.

### How It Works

1. Keywords from the attack pattern (payload and encoded values) are extracted
2. These keywords are highlighted with `<mark>` tags
3. Background color: `#FFFF00` (fluorescent yellow)

### Example

In the screenshot above, `SLEEP%285%29` is highlighted in yellow, making it easy to spot the attack payload in the Falco log entry.

### Benefits

- **Quick identification**: Instantly see what triggered the detection
- **Visual confirmation**: Verify the correct pattern was matched
- **Reduced review time**: No need to manually search for keywords

## Graphs Page

![Graphs Page](images/e2e-report-graphs.png)

The Graphs page provides visual analytics:

### Status (Pie Chart)

Shows the distribution of test results:
- **Green**: Passed
- **Red**: Failed
- **Orange**: Broken
- **Gray**: Skipped
- **Purple**: Unknown

### Severity (Bar Chart)

Shows tests grouped by severity level:
- blocker
- critical (most E2E tests)
- normal
- minor
- trivial

### Duration (Histogram)

Shows the distribution of test execution times. Most tests complete in 1-2ms.

### Duration Trend

Line chart showing total test duration across runs. Useful for identifying performance regressions.

### Trend

Stacked bar chart showing pass/fail counts across runs. Demonstrates stability over time.

### Retries Trend

Shows retry patterns across runs (ideally should be flat at 0).

### Categories Trend

Shows category-based results across runs.

## Quick Reference

### Interpreting Results

| Indicator | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| 100% pass | All attacks detected | Good - rules working correctly |
| < 100% pass | Some attacks missed | Review failed tests, update rules |
| Category failures | Specific category issues | Focus rule improvements on that category |

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Low detection rate | Rules not matching | Check rule conditions and field names |
| High latency | Slow log processing | Check Falco performance, log volume |
| Missing evidence | Log rotation/truncation | Increase log retention |
